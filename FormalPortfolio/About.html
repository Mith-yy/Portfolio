        <p class="About-Text">
          I'm Mithran, a 14-year-old amateur photography enthusiast with a
          passion for aviation and technology—while I'm not a professional and
          shoot solely on an iPhone 15, I’m driven by curiosity and a growing
          creative eye, with a dream to one day explore and capture the natural
          beauty of places like Alaska. I've always strived to picture
          everything around me in new angles and light to bring to the people
          around me a perspective they never imagined and making them see my
          love in everyday sights around us. I also pride myself in being an
          intermediate level coder, mainly specialising in Lua and recently got
          into front-end web development. I've helped beginners find their
          footing and solve their bugs in their Roblox games via Discord
          servers, and also contributed to a game with more than 25 million
          visits.

        <p class="About-Text">
          As a proud student in Victoria School, Singapore I pride myself in
          being academically-strong while also being able to explore new
          interests and skills. Outside of technology and photography, i enjoy
          playing various sports like floorball, football and basketball. I'm
          often surrounded by like-minded Victorians, ambitious and hardworking.
          Since young, I've always been more outgoing than the rest, willing to
          offer a helping hand. I hope to continue what I'm doing, network with
          more people and progress in not only skills but in character.
